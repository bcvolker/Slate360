# URGENT: Next.js Vercel Deployment Issue - Changes Not Appearing

## Problem Summary
I have a Next.js project deployed on Vercel where ALL changes are committed and pushed to GitHub, builds succeed, but changes don't appear on the deployed website. This has been going on for hours despite multiple attempts to fix it.

## Project Details
- **Repository**: bcvolker/Slate360 (GitHub)
- **Frontend Directory**: C:\Slate360\frontend
- **Vercel Projects**: 
  - slate360.vercel.app (main)
  - slate360devbuild.vercel.app (duplicate - should be deleted)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.5
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel

## Current Status
✅ **Git**: All changes committed and pushed to main branch  
✅ **Files**: Changes exist locally and in GitHub  
✅ **Build**: npm run build succeeds locally  
✅ **Vercel Config**: Root directory set to "frontend"  
✅ **Deployment**: Vercel shows successful deployments  
❌ **Result**: Changes don't appear on live website  

## Changes Made (Not Appearing)
1. **Logo Size**: Increased from h-12 to h-20 (80px height)
2. **Navigation Links**: Changed from gray to black text with semibold font
3. **Header**: Made transparent (bg-transparent instead of bg-black/90)
4. **Reports & Analytics Tile**: Added missing viewer with analytics icon
5. **CEO Dashboard**: Created new page at /ceo
6. **Footer**: Added social media icons and legal links
7. **Layout**: Changed from AppShell to SimpleAppShell (removed sidebar menu)

## Key Files Modified
- `src/components/CleanHeader.tsx` - New header component
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage with tiles
- `src/app/ceo/page.tsx` - CEO dashboard
- `src/app-shell/SimpleAppShell.tsx` - New layout
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout
- `src/app-shell/index.ts` - Exports

## Diagnostic Results
```powershell
# Changes ARE in files
Select-String -Path "src\components\CleanHeader.tsx" -Pattern "h-20"
# Result: src\components\CleanHeader.tsx:25: className="h-20 w-auto"

Select-String -Path "src\app\page.tsx" -Pattern "REPORTS & ANALYTICS"
# Result: src\app\page.tsx:306: title: 'REPORTS & ANALYTICS'

Test-Path "src\app\ceo\page.tsx"
# Result: True

# Git is correct
git branch -a
# Result: * main, remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main, remotes/origin/main

git log --oneline -3
# Result: 47a0f7c (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
```

## Recent Commits
```
47a0f7c - Fix: Replace legacy HTML comment with JS comment to resolve build error
6559b5a - Test deployment - obvious change
0bbd3b5 - Remove conflicting Header components - this should fix the deployment issue
```

## Vercel Configuration
- **Root Directory**: frontend ✅
- **Node.js Version**: 22.x ✅
- **Build Command**: npm run build ✅
- **Output Directory**: .next ✅
- **Branch**: main ✅

## Build Logs Analysis
- **Previous Issue**: HTML comments in JSX caused build failures
- **Fixed**: Replaced `<!-- -->` with `//` comments
- **Current Status**: Build succeeds, deployment completes
- **Runtime Logs**: Show 200 responses (site is working)

## Attempted Solutions (All Failed)
1. ✅ Fixed corrupted export in app-shell/index.ts
2. ✅ Removed conflicting Header.tsx files
3. ✅ Fixed HTML comment syntax errors
4. ✅ Verified git pushes are working
5. ✅ Confirmed Vercel is looking at correct files
6. ✅ Tried hard refresh, different browsers, incognito mode
7. ✅ Added obvious test changes that don't appear
8. ✅ Verified changes exist in source files

## Critical Questions for AI Assistant
1. **Why are changes not appearing despite successful builds?**
2. **Is there a Vercel configuration issue I'm missing?**
3. **Could there be a caching issue at the CDN level?**
4. **Are there multiple deployment pipelines conflicting?**
5. **Is there a Next.js configuration preventing changes?**
6. **Could there be a build output directory issue?**

## Test URLs
- https://slate360.vercel.app
- https://slate360devbuild.vercel.app

## Expected Changes (Not Visible)
- Larger logo (h-20 instead of h-12)
- Black navigation links (instead of gray)
- Reports & Analytics tile with viewer
- CEO dashboard at /ceo
- Social media icons in footer
- Legal links in footer
- Transparent header (no black bar)

## Environment
- **OS**: Windows 10
- **PowerShell**: Latest version
- **Node.js**: 22.x
- **NPM**: Latest version
- **Git**: Latest version

## What I Need
A definitive solution that will make my changes appear on the live website. I've tried all the obvious fixes and need expert-level troubleshooting to identify the root cause.

## Additional Context
- This is a production website that needs to go live
- All code changes are correct and working locally
- The issue is specifically with Vercel deployment
- Multiple AI assistants have provided solutions that didn't work
- I need a working solution, not more diagnostic steps

## Files Available for Analysis
- All source code files
- package.json with dependencies
- next.config.mjs configuration
- Vercel deployment logs
- Git commit history
- Build output logs

Please provide a step-by-step solution that will definitively resolve this deployment issue.
