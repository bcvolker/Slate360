# AI Assistant Prompt: Vercel Deployment Issue - Changes Not Appearing

## Problem Summary
The user has a Next.js project deployed on Vercel where changes are committed and pushed to GitHub but are not appearing on the deployed website. This issue started after making header changes.

## What We've Already Tried (Didn't Work)
1. ✅ Created `vercel.json` configuration file with proper build settings
2. ✅ Performed cache-busting redeployment with empty commit
3. ✅ Verified changes are in GitHub repository
4. ✅ Confirmed Vercel build process completes successfully

## Current Status
- **Repository**: bcvolker/Slate360 (main branch)
- **Frontend Directory**: C:\Slate360\frontend
- **Vercel Projects**: 
  - slate360devbuild.vercel.app
  - slate360.vercel.app
- **Issue**: Changes committed and pushed but not visible on deployed site
- **Timeline**: Issue started after changing header components

## Key Changes Made (Not Appearing on Website)

### 1. CleanHeader Component (`src/components/CleanHeader.tsx`)
- Logo size increased from h-12 to h-20 (80px height)
- Navigation links changed from gray to black text with semibold font
- Header made transparent (bg-transparent instead of bg-black/90)

### 2. Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Added missing "Reports & Analytics" tile with analytics icon
- Reduced tile heights from 500px to 400px
- Reduced heading sizes for better fit
- Added social media icons and legal links to footer

### 3. CEO Dashboard (`src/app/ceo/page.tsx`)
- Created complete new CEO dashboard page
- Features: Upload functionality, content library, stats overview

### 4. Layout Changes (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Changed from AppShell to SimpleAppShell
- Removed sidebar menu that was covering logo area

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Build Command**: npm run build
- **Output Directory**: .next
- **Node.js Version**: 22.x

## Files to Examine
1. `frontend/src/components/CleanHeader.tsx` - New header component
2. `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage with tiles
3. `frontend/src/app/ceo/page.tsx` - CEO dashboard
4. `frontend/src/app-shell/SimpleAppShell.tsx` - New layout
5. `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout
6. `frontend/package.json` - Dependencies
7. `frontend/next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
8. `frontend/vercel.json` - Vercel configuration

## Recent Commits
```
6f571ca - build: Force fresh redeployment to clear Vercel cache
48525d9 - Previous commit with actual changes
```

## What We Need You To Do
1. **Investigate why changes aren't appearing** despite successful builds
2. **Check for potential issues** with:
   - CDN caching
   - Multiple Vercel projects conflicting
   - Build configuration problems
   - File sync issues
   - Deployment pipeline problems
3. **Provide specific solutions** to make changes visible on the deployed site
4. **Test with obvious changes** to confirm deployment process works

## Expected Visible Changes (Currently Missing)
- Larger logo (h-20 instead of h-12)
- Black navigation links (instead of gray)
- Reports & Analytics tile with viewer
- CEO dashboard accessible at /ceo
- Social media icons in footer
- Legal links in footer
- Transparent header (no black background)

## Additional Context
The user cannot read or write code and prefers instructions with exact folder locations and command-line prompts to copy and paste. They prefer addressing root causes rather than applying individual fixes sequentially.

Please provide specific, actionable solutions with exact commands and file paths.
