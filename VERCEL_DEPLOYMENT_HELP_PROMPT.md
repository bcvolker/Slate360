# SLATE360 Vercel Deployment Issue - AI Assistance Request

## Problem Summary
Our Next.js application is building successfully on Vercel, but it's displaying an **old, incorrect design** instead of the current code. The git pushes are working correctly, but Vercel seems to be deploying from cached or incorrect content.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Git pushes working**: Commits are reaching GitHub successfully
- ✅ **Build successful**: Vercel builds complete without errors
- ❌ **Wrong design deployed**: Vercel shows old design despite correct commits
- ❌ **Cache issue suspected**: Latest commits not reflected in deployment

## What We Need Help With
1. **Vercel cache clearing**: How to force Vercel to use fresh code
2. **Deployment troubleshooting**: Why correct commits show wrong design
3. **Build optimization**: Ensuring Vercel uses the latest source code
4. **Environment variables**: Check if missing env vars cause fallback to old design

## Technical Details
- **Repository**: https://github.com/bcvolker/Slate360.git
- **Current commit**: 68d8aa6 (fix: resolve server/client component error)
- **Vercel project**: Connected to main branch
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.5
- **Issue**: Design shows old layout instead of new homepage tiles

## Files to Check
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Main homepage component
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root layout
- `frontend/next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
- `frontend/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

## Expected vs Actual
- **Expected**: Light-themed background, redesigned homepage tiles, correct "Slate360" branding
- **Actual**: Old dark theme, incorrect layout, wrong styling

## Questions for AI Assistants
1. How do we force Vercel to clear its build cache?
2. What Vercel settings might cause old code to be deployed?
3. How do we verify Vercel is using the correct commit?
4. What debugging steps should we take to identify the root cause?

## Next Steps Needed
- Clear Vercel build cache
- Verify deployment settings
- Check for environment variable issues
